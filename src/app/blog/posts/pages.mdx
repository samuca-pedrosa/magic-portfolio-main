## My foundation: God

God is my foundation for everything in life. He is the one who gives me strength, wisdom and direction in every project, every challenge and every achievement. My faith is not just a belief, but the foundation that sustains all my dreams and accomplishments.


It is through prayer and trust in Him that I find purpose in every line of code I write and every idea I develop. As Philippians 4:13 says: "I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me".

## My family: my inspiration

My family is my greatest treasure and inexhaustible source of motivation. My mother, with her unconditional love and wise advice, always knows how to comfort me in difficult times and celebrate my victories. My father, with his strength and example of hard work, taught me the value of persistence and integrity. My brother is not just a sibling, but my companion in adventures and dreams - we share laughs, support each other, and together we face any challenge that life brings us.

And there's MY Jojô, my dear girlfriend, my princess, who is the light of my days. She is not just my companion, but my greatest inspirer and encourager. With her affection, support and unconditional love, she shows me that dreams become even more beautiful when shared. Jojô teaches me daily about patience, dedication and how true love can transform any challenge into an opportunity to grow together.
